# Python-Project-Metric-Converter-3
The User Will Firstly Be Asked Their Weight And The User Can Put Their Weight In Whichever Metric They Are More Comfortable With. Upon Completion Of The First Prompt, The User Will Then Be Asked About Whether The Weight They Entered Was Measured In Kg or Lbs. If The User Picks The Metric They Used To Enter Their Weight Then They Will Be Shown The Weight In The Other Metric (i.e Kg Converted To Lbs / Lbs Converted To Kg)

Within The First Piece Of Code I Converted The String Of The Users Weight Into A Float For Future Reference When Using That Variable In A Formula So The Compiler Recognized Two Numerical Values Being Used Together To Create The Converted Metric Calculation.

I Used The Measurement Of How Many Kg In 1Lbs Which Was 0.45Kg And Used This Measurement In My if Statements To Find The Converted Metric Measurement Of The Users Weight So If The User Chose L for Lbs The Compiler Will Use My if Statement Dedicated To The Formula Of Converting Lbs To Kg Which Was The Users Weight Multiplied By 0.45. The Formula To Convert Kg To Lbs It Is Users Weight Divided By 0.45.
